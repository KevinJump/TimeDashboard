# Time Dashboard Demo. 

Gives you a dashboard, where you can ask the server for the time or date. 


this demostrates the flow to get information from a controller on a server. 

```
element -> context -> respository -> store -> resource
```

. but it currently doesn't work for authenticated controllers 😞
